# Algorithms Learning Website

## Overview
Welcome to the Algorithms Learning Website, a personal project aimed at learning React, Docker, Redis, Firebase, and various web development technologies. This interactive learning environment offers a rich coding experience, discussion boards, and a collaborative community to enhance your algorithmic skills. 
### Disclaimer
Please keep in mind that this project was primarily created for personal learning and experimentation purposes and may not provide a polished, production-ready experience for users and `a loot of the backend is not hosted for now which breaks a loot of the code` so i will add images of how it looked when i was running it everything.

## Features
### Rich Coding Environment
- **Coding Challenges:** Explore a wide range of algorithmic problems and challenges in various difficulty levels.
- **Code Execution:** Write, test, and execute code in multiple programming languages including C, C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Enjoy code readability with syntax highlighting for different languages.
- **Customizable Workspace:** Tailor your coding workspace with adjustable windows and layouts.
- **Dark and Light Mode:** Switch between dark and light mode to suit your preference.

### Community Interaction
- **Discussion Boards:** Engage in discussions, ask questions, and share your insights with a community of learners.
- **User Profiles:** Track your progress, completed challenges, and contributions through your user profile.

### Task Creation
- **Create Challenges:** Contribute to the platform by creating new algorithmic challenges for other users to solve.
- **Test Cases:** Define custom test cases for your challenges to thoroughly evaluate solutions.

## How It Works
The Algorithms Learning Website is built using a combination of technologies to provide a seamless learning experience:

- **Frontend:** The frontend of the website is developed using React, providing a dynamic and interactive user interface.

- **Code Execution:** Code execution is securely managed within Docker containers, allowing users to run and test their code safely.

- **Database:** While the Firebase backend is currently disabled, it's intended to store user profiles, discussions, and challenge data securely.

- **Authentication:** Users can sign in to the platform to track their progress and contribute to the community.

- **Self-Imposed Timer:** Utilize the built-in timer in the coding editor to self-impose time limits on your coding challenges, adding an element of time management to your problem-solving process.

## Get Started
Please note that a lot of the website backend is not currently running and therfor a lot is broken, i would like to get back to this and get proper hosting up in the future but dont have time for it now.

1. Visit the [Algorithms Learning Website](https://frederik-it.netlify.app/) to explore the platform.
2. Sign in or create an account to access personalized features.
3. Browse coding challenges, engage in discussions, and collaborate with other learners.
4. Enjoy the rich coding environment with syntax highlighting, code execution, and adjustable windows.
5. Create your own algorithmic challenges and share them with the community.

## Future Development
Please note that while some features of the website may currently be disabled or not fully functional, development on this project has temporarily ceased. Since this project was primarily a learning endeavor and does not have any active users, there is no immediate timeline for updates. Nevertheless, the knowledge gained from this project will continue to contribute to future learning and development efforts.
